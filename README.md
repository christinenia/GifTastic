# Giftastic
I created a pokemon themed site that has 10 buttons already populated at the top of the screen.  Once the user selects a button, the site will then generate 10 still gifs based on the selection.  If the user clicks on a gif, the still gif will then animate.  The user will also have an option to search their own pokemon gif (or any gif of their liking).
